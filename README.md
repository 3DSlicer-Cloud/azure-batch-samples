# azure-batch-samples
This GitHub repository contains a set of HPC and Batch related samples that demonstrate the usage of Microsoft Azure Batch services along with some general purpose utilities. See [http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch/](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch/) for more information on the Azure Batch Service.

**Batch Account**

Before you can interact with the Batch service, you will need an Azure Batch service account. The Azure Batch service is currently in preview; apply for access to the Batch service here: [https://account.windowsazure.com/PreviewFeatures](https://account.windowsazure.com/PreviewFeatures).

After obtaining access to the service, you can create a Batch account either on the [Azure.com management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) or by using Azure PowerShell to create the account as described at [this blog](http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowshpc/archive/2014/10/28/using-azure-powershell-to-manage-azure-batch-account.aspx).

**Azure Storage Viewer**

It will be useful to have a Azure Storage viewer available to assist with maintaining containers and blobs as well as observing interaction the samples have with storage. There are a number of free viewers available.
