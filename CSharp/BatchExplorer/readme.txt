Once the app is running, you need to configure it with data from your Azure subscription.

1. On the Accounts menu click "Add Default Account Manager". The "Add Account" dialog opens.
2. In the Account Alias box, type in any name you like. Use the name to create distinct batch jobs.
3. For the Batch Service Url, go to your subscription and copy the URL. Paste it into the box.
4. For the Account box, go to your subscription and copy the name of the Batch. Paste it into the box.
5. For the Key box, go to your suscription and copy the Primary Key, then paste it into the box.

The values are saved automatically, and loaded when you run the file again.

By default, a "testbatch" is created for you using the URL, account, and key values.
