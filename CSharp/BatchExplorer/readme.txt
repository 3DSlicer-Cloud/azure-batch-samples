Once the BatchExplorer is running, you need to configure it with data about your Batch account.

1. On the Accounts menu click "Add Default Account Manager". The "Add Account" dialog opens.
2. In the Account Alias box, type in any name you like. This is the friendly name of the Batch Account and will show up in the BatchExplorer UI.
3. For the Batch Service Url, go to your subscription and copy the URL. Paste it into the box.
4. For the Account box, go to your subscription and copy the name of the Batch Account. Paste it into the box.
5. For the Key box, go to your suscription and copy the Primary Key, then paste it into the box.

After you press ok, the values are saved and can be reloaded whenever you run BatchExplorer.
